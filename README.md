# UC Berkeley PHYS 111B â€“ Physics Lab Analysis

This repository contains selected data analysis work from my physics laboratory coursework at UC Berkeley (PHYSICS 111B). Each project uses Python ( `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`) to process, analyze, and visualize experimental data. Reports were written in LaTeX.

> **Note:** This repository is a work in progress as I continue to work on data analysis and notebook cleaning. 

##Included Labs##
- **Muon Lifetime (MUO)**
- **Opticul Pumping (OPT)**
- **Hall Effect in Semiconductor (SHE)**
- **Nonlinear Dynamics (NLD)**

## About
These labs were completed as part of the Spring 2025/Fall 2025 PHYS 111B lab course at UC Berkeley. The code and data here reflect both independent work and collaborative stages of the lab process. Future updates will continue to refine the analysis and documentation.
